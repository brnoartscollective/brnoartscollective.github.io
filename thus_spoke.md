Thus Spoke is a literary magazine produced as a part of Brno Arts Collective. Sharing the same
values as the collective, we believe it is paramount to cultivate and maintain a respect and pursuit
for excellence in regards to art and more specifically the craft of writing.

In his essay on Tradition, T.S. Eliot posits the idea that the individuality of the poet is only
found within the scale of the literary tradition as a whole. As he explains, this knowledge and
understanding of tradition is not inherited but is rather an act of labour.

We have decided as a collective and magazine to make tradition the pillar on which we stand, to
partake in the labour which Eliot refers to. Not as an intention to have our work be a feeble
reproduction of previous writers but rather to use the art and work as a foundation from which we
can expound upon, creating and pushing the boundaries all the while.

With the desire for individuality, one must acknowledge that one cannot create something new without
knowing what has already been done, one cannot express the same mundane sentiment through a
different lens if they have not already familiarized themself and gazed through the lens of previous
minds.

> These pages are measured with coffee spoons.

Each edition of Thus Spoke will be a reference to a writer that we as a collective revere. The first
edition will be dedicated to T.S. Eliot, the title being, Thus Spoke Prufrock.

We have chosen T.S. Eliot because of his mastery in poetry and his respect and opinion regarding
Tradition and the art of poetry as a craft.
